            \entry{ Effectively used Docker to containerize our team's ML inference binary for Windows and Linux. }
            \entry{ Customers pull containers containing the binary and all dependencies built in and fire up the isolated container in the background, listening for requests from the host machine via shared unix socket.}
            \entry{ Containers also expose system metrics and metrics from the binary through a published port. }
